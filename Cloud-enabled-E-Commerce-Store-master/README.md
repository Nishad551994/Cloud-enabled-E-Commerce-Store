# Cloud-enabled-E-Commerce-Store

Hello friends,
I have created a project which is based on php language, the speciality of this project is that it has been implemented using cloud characteristics and refine search algorithm.

Steps to run the project:
1.  download the zip file from my repository, and extract the file
2.  This project needs wampserver to run a virtual server. Once the server is up and running.
3.  Open the "index.php" file in the browser. The data will be loaded from database i.e. SQL.

Thanks for checking out my repository and please do check my other projects to. and thanks for visiting my GitHub Account. Please do suggest any recommendations, it will be highly appreciated.
